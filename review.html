                <h1>Mitigating personal information exposure on the web</h1>
                <p>The innovation of online websites enabling its users to share and exchange information over the web
                    has caused a critical issue for not only users but companies collecting and storing the
                    information. With user information being collected without exception on most sites, safeguarding
                    this information from public availability is likely to be a challenge.</p>
                <h2>Social networking sites</h2>
                <p>Social networking sites (SNS) such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have a massive role in
                    forestalling personal information exposure on the web. According to Zhang, Li, (Robert) Luo &
                    Warkentin, (2016), the innovation of technology has enabled users to exchange information more
                    efficiently and effectively. Furthermore raising a critical issue with the storing and sharing of
                    this information. “These innovative technological artifacts have enabled individual users and
                    organizational constituents to seek, share, and ex-change information efficiently and effectively.
                    This phenomenon, coupled with dynamic globalization, has raised a critical issue with regard to the
                    ubiquitous dis-tributed storage and sharing of information vis-a-vis information privacy” (Zhang,
                    Li, (Robert) Luo & Warkentin, 2016). In addition to the critical issue with the storing and sharing
                    of the information. Zhang, Li, (Robert) Luo & Warkentin, (2016) considered how social networking
                    sites rely heavily on the monetization of users information which provides an incentive to
                    stimulate maximum disclosure from the user, increasing the amount of personal information available
                    on the web. “SNS’s survival and profitability largely rely on monetizing users’ personal
                    information through targeted advertisements and personalized products or services, an SNS has an
                    inherent incentive to stimulate maximum disclosure” (Zhang, Li, (Robert) Luo & Warkentin, 2016)</p>
                <p>Mitigating personal information exposure on the web is likely to cause a conflict between social
                    networking sites and its users. Zhang, Li, (Robert) Luo & Warkentin, (2016) deliberates the user's
                    evasive behaviour towards disclosing their information to social networking sites.“if such conflict
                    is not handled properly by an SNS, users are likely to be unwilling to disclose their personal
                    information to the SNS, which would then adversely affect the SNS’s profitability in the long
                    run.”(Zhang, Li, (Robert) Luo & Warkentin, 2016)</p>
                <h2>Third party privacy concerns</h2>
                <p>Third parties to websites cause privacy concerns for users. Gopal, Hidaji, Patterson, Rolland &
                    Zhdanov, (2018) considered the triggers that cause many third parties to collect information as the
                    user navigates the web. “A visit to an online news site may trigger inter-actions with hundreds of
                    other parties that may be collecting information on the consumer as he travels the web.” (Gopal,
                    Hidaji, Patterson, Rolland & Zhdanov, 2018). Furthermore, Gopal, Hidaji, Patterson, Rolland &
                    Zhdanov, (2018) suggested that the sharing of the information with third parties is done without
                    the consent of the users through the most common mechanism cookies, and with no disclosure of what
                    is being collected. “The most familiar sharing mechanism involves the use of cookies, but other
                    more sophisticated approaches exist as well. This sharing of user information with third parties is
                    typically done without explicit user consent or appropriate disclosure mechanisms.” (Gopal, Hidaji,
                    Patterson, Rolland & Zhdanov, 2018) Yet, Goddard, (2017) suggests that the new GDPR laws in Europe
                    now prevent the unknowing processing of users personal information without their consent, such as
                    cookies, IP addresses, digital fingerprinting and location data. “The new law covers the personal
                    data of all EU residents, regardless of the location of the processing. Personal data is
                    information that, directly or indirectly, can identify an individual, and specifically includes
                    online identifiers such as IP addresses, cookies and digital fingerprinting, and location data that
                    could identify individuals.” (Goddard, 2017)</p>
                <h2>Public WiFi / Hotspots</h2>
                <p>Free Public Wifi locations cause many possible risks and dangers for web users, so deterring users
                    from connecting to them is a considerable way to mitigate personal information exposure on the web.
                    Hornbeck, (2018) explores how the NewYork City wifi has caused the general public uneasiness after
                    the sinister side of the network was revealed. “LinkNYC also had a potentially sinister side: the
                    specter of a mass surveillance network of cameras and sensors for law enforcement to follow New
                    Yorkers wherever they went.” (Hornbeck, 2018) Unknowingly to a lot of public WIFI users, a vast
                    amount of personal information can be collected from the network. Hornbeck, (2018) suggests that
                    information such as “location tracking, historical location data, and (potentially) facial
                    recognition technology.”(Hornbeck, 2018) can all be collected from a network.</p>
                <p>Shahin,(2016) contribution to literature shares a similar perspective as Hornbeck, (2018) as
                    throughout the article talks in depth about the unencrypted network traffic that could be easily
                    intercepted with “cheap, easily available software” (Shahin, 2016). Shahin,(2016) additionally
                    suggests that wifi hotspot users are oblivious to the potential risks. </p>
                <p>Furthermore, Shahin, (2016) elaborates further on some of the methods of stealing users information
                    off the network “sniffing, (2) evil twins, (3) man-in-the-middle-attacks, and (4) sidejacking. "
                    (Shahin, 2016). A key focus of Shahin, (2016) literature is on evil twins, “a rogue WiFi access
                    point that appears to be legitimate but actually has been set up by a hacker to fool wireless users
                    into connecting” (Shahin, 2016) Hsu, Wang, Hsu, Cheng & Hsneh, (2017) proposed a client-based
                    detection system to mitigate users from connecting to such networks, potentially putting their
                    personal information at risk.“we propose a client-based detection mechanism, called evil twin
                    detector, to detect this type of attacks. An evil twin detector changes its wireless network
                    interface card (WNIC) to monitor mode to capture wireless TCP/IP packets. Through analyzing
                    captured packets, our detector allows client users to easily and precisely detect an evil twin,
                    thus avoids threats” created by evil twins”(Hsu, Wang, Hsu, Cheng & Hsneh, 2017)</p>
