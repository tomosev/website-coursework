                    <h1>Mitigating personal information exposure on the web</h1>
                    <p>The innovation of online websites enabling its users to share and exchange information over the web has caused a critical issue for not only users but companies collecting and storing the information. With user information being collected without exception on most sites, safeguarding this information from public availability is likely to be a challenge.</p>
                    <h2>Social networking sites</h2>
                    <p>Social networking sites (SNS)  such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have a massive role in forestalling personal information exposure on the web. According to Zhang, Li, (Robert) Luo & Warkentin, (2016), the innovation of technology has enabled users to exchange information more efficiently and effectively. Furthermore raising a critical issue with the storing and sharing of this information. “These innovative technological artifacts have enabled individual users and organizational constituents to seek, share, and ex-change information efficiently and effectively. This phenomenon, coupled with dynamic globalization, has raised a critical issue with regard to the ubiquitous dis-tributed storage and sharing of information vis-a-vis information privacy” (Zhang, Li, (Robert) Luo & Warkentin, 2016). In addition to the critical issue with the storing and sharing of the information. Zhang, Li, (Robert) Luo & Warkentin, (2016) considered how social networking sites rely heavily on the monetization of users information which provides an incentive to stimulate maximum disclosure from the user, increasing the amount of personal information available on the web. “SNS’s survival and profitability largely rely on monetizing users’ personal information through targeted advertisements and personalized products or services, an SNS has an inherent incentive to stimulate maximum disclosure” (Zhang, Li, (Robert) Luo & Warkentin, 2016)</p>
                    <p>Mitigating personal information exposure on the web is likely to cause a conflict between social networking sites and its users. Zhang, Li, (Robert) Luo & Warkentin, (2016) deliberates the user's evasive behaviour towards disclosing their information to social networking sites.“if such conflict is not handled properly by an SNS, users are likely to be unwilling to disclose their personal information to the SNS, which would then adversely affect the SNS’s profitability in the long run.”(Zhang, Li, (Robert) Luo & Warkentin, 2016)</p>
                    <h2>Third party privacy concerns</h2>
                    <p>Third parties to websites cause privacy concerns for users. Gopal, Hidaji, Patterson, Rolland & Zhdanov, (2018) considered the triggers that cause many third parties to collect information as the user navigates the web. “A visit to an online news site may trigger inter-actions with hundreds of other parties that may be collecting information on the consumer as he travels the web.” (Gopal, Hidaji, Patterson, Rolland & Zhdanov, 2018). Furthermore, Gopal, Hidaji, Patterson, Rolland & Zhdanov, (2018) suggested that the sharing of the information with third parties is done without the consent of the users through the most common mechanism cookies, and with no disclosure of what is being collected. “The most familiar sharing mechanism involves the use of cookies, but other more sophisticated approaches exist as well. This sharing of user information with third parties is typically done without explicit user consent or appropriate disclosure mechanisms.” (Gopal, Hidaji, Patterson, Rolland & Zhdanov, 2018) Yet, Goddard, (2017) suggests that the new GDPR laws in Europe now prevent the unknowing processing of users personal information without their consent, such as cookies, IP addresses, digital fingerprinting and location data. “The new law covers the personal data of all EU residents, regardless of the location of the processing. Personal data is information that, directly or indirectly, can identify an individual, and specifically includes online identifiers such as IP addresses, cookies and digital fingerprinting, and location data that could identify individuals.” (Goddard, 2017)</p>
                    <h2>Public WiFi / Hotspots</h2>
                    <p>Free Public Wifi locations cause many possible risks and dangers for web users, so deterring users from connecting to them is a considerable way to mitigate personal information exposure on the web. Hornbeck, (2018) explores how the NewYork City wifi has caused the general public uneasiness after the sinister side of the network was revealed. “LinkNYC also had a potentially sinister side: the specter of a mass surveillance network of cameras and sensors for law enforcement to follow New Yorkers wherever they went.” (Hornbeck, 2018) Unknowingly to a lot of public WIFI users, a vast amount of personal information can be collected from the network. Hornbeck, (2018) suggests that information such as “location tracking, historical location data, and (potentially) facial recognition technology.”(Hornbeck, 2018) can all be collected from a network.</p>
                    <p>Shahin,(2016) contribution to literature shares a similar perspective as Hornbeck, (2018) as throughout the article talks in depth about the unencrypted network traffic that could be easily intercepted with “cheap, easily available software” (Shahin, 2016). Shahin,(2016) additionally suggests that wifi hotspot users are oblivious to the potential risks. </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, Shahin, (2016)  elaborates further on some of the methods of stealing users information off the network “sniffing, (2) evil twins, (3) man-in-the-middle-attacks, and (4) sidejacking. " (Shahin, 2016). A key focus of Shahin, (2016) literature is on evil twins, “a rogue WiFi access point that appears to be legitimate but actually has been set up by a hacker to fool wireless users into connecting” (Shahin, 2016)  Hsu, Wang, Hsu, Cheng & Hsneh, (2017) proposed a client-based detection system to mitigate users from connecting to such networks, potentially putting their personal information at risk.“we propose a client-based detection mechanism, called evil twin detector, to detect this type of attacks. An evil twin detector changes its wireless network interface card (WNIC) to monitor mode to capture wireless TCP/IP packets. Through analyzing captured packets, our detector allows client users to easily and precisely detect an evil twin, thus avoids threats” created by evil twins”(Hsu, Wang, Hsu, Cheng & Hsneh, 2017)</p>
